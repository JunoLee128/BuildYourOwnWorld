##Abhi notes
* Going to use A* to make the hallways between rooms
* Trying to decide on algorith to spawn rooms, 
right now I'm gonna make it random so I can test the A* algorithm.
  
* Implemented your random room generation into a helper class I made for room generation.
* Thinking maybe we should first generate hallways, then make rooms as we go.
* Also thinking when making rooms and hallaways, we only make floor tiles, then at the end we 
surround the floor tiles with walls.
* Adding this so i can commit
