# BuildYourOwnWorld
Build-Your-Own-World Project for CS61B

I worked with Abhi Alderman on this project over the course of 3 weeks in Spring 2021. This was our final project for the class. 
The deliverable product features a procedurally generated map, interactive controls, and rudimentary enemy pathfinding AI.
